  <h2>My Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    I was motivated to learn coding and web development by my friend 
    <strong>Naman 💙</strong>. His guidance and encouragement inspired me 
    to start this journey and build my own websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first time I created a simple webpage, I felt excited to see my 
    ideas come alive on screen. That moment gave me confidence and a 
    strong desire to keep learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to become a skilled web developer, mastering technologies 
    like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</strong>. I dream of 
    building websites and applications that not only look creative but 
    also make people’s lives easier.
